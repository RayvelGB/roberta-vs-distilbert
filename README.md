# RoBERTa vs DistilBERT: Comparative Study for Hate Speech Detection
This repository contains the code from our research project titled:
**"Hate Speech Detection: A Comparison Between RoBERTa and DistilBERT."**

This project focuses on comparing two transformer-based NLP models (RoBERTa & DistilBERT) in the task of classifying Reddit posts into three categories:
- Hate
- Neutral
- Counter-hate

🔍 **Objective**

To evaluate and compare the performance, efficiency, and effectiveness of RoBERTa and DistilBERT on a multi-class hate speech detection task using real-world Reddit data.

📁 **Contents**
- Preprocessing scripts
- Model training
- Model evaluation

🚀 **Tools & Frameworks**
- Python
- Transformers (HuggingFace)
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab (initial development)
